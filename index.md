## Short bio

I am a lecturer at the Institute of Economic Studies, Charles University [(IES FSV UK)](https://ies.fsv.cuni.cz). I have completed my Ph.D. research under the supervision of [doc. PhDr. Jozef Baruník, Ph.D.](https://barunik.github.io) Simultaneously, I am a researcher at Institute of Information Theory and Automation at the Czech Academy of Sciences (ÚTIA).

I concentrate my research on the field of financial econometrics. Specifically, I am interested in asset pricing, effects of various sources of risks with heterogeneous persistence, connectedness on financial markets, and time-variability of asset pricing relationships. My other research interest is predicting the outcomes of sporting events.




### Research Interests

- **Asset pricing:** heterogeneously persistent risks, time-varying predictability, higher moment risks
- **Other interests:** predicting sport outcomes, betting strategies, connectedness
